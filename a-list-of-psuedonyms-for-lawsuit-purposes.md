### Preventing the Patriarchy with Pseudonyms

> "But he's a _man_. That can't be right here. Aren't we letting men win this way?"

Personally, I'd say I'm _the_ man, but that's actually somewhat complicated given Federal, County, and Local law enforcement's involvement.

That said, it's been my personal wish should this become a movie for my dumb ass to be acted by dozens of actors and actresses of all genders, races, sizes, ages, and most importantly, a diversity of heights. My behavior to this point has been truly beneath and defiant of all such categories, I'm sure, and I'd like for that to be reflected in any record.

In the spirit of that possibility, I'd also opt for a pseudonym as a potential plaintiff in any lawsuits. I'd like for this story to be told in such a way that all human beings have an equal opportunity to be as foolish for the fate of their fellow citizens as I was forced to be.

Here's a running list of options to keep me busy seeking attention in a hopefully less caustic way that allows for those above my status in life to figure things out.

And PS - I'm going to make sure my legal team is led by the opposite of Atticus Finch - which is to say winners, but more to the point, women. Also non fictional.

Without further adieu, the pseudonyms:

1. Citizen Celebutaunt
1. Snotboogie

1. S. Undenlee Seymour

1. Citizen Wasn't The One
