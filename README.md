### An Opportunity For All via Justice for Some

If you're reading this, you're aware my privacy has been invaded in a peculiar set of ways.

There are two major legal opportunities to be had via legal actions and lawsuits that I can take - only once I know whom has been invading my privacy. I've always figured I'd learn one way or the other, it would just take the right opportunity. Now there are two such opportunities to set legal precedents by making certain arguments in court such to potentially expand civil rights for all Americans!

The first argument and opportunity is this: if someone's privacy is invaded across state lines via the utility of the internet, with audio and visual recordings being made non consensually in particular, whose jurisdiction is it anyway? While my privacy was invaded in New York and New Jersey, it was presumably linked via the internet the whole time to actors, speaking broadly, in California and other states. California state law is particularly more aggressive towards protecting the right to privacy, in many forms and many ways, than New York and to an extent even New Jersey.

The second argument and opportunity is perhaps greater: can any medical reason whatsoever justify an invasion of privacy in any form? Or, in other words, what is the legal relationship between privacy and medicine? This is to assume that my privacy was invaded for the sake of a medicinal reason. Privacy's lack of legal relations to medicine was the grounds for a previous hot button societal issue, the right to abortion, to be decided as it was. That said, the medicinal reason in question with my own privacy's invasion is not really a hot button issue - not too many people get millions of dollars spent on them to try and misdiagnose them because of other people misunderstanding the business, content, and higher duty to society of cinema - but I digress. Not all of us were so privileged to have worked at a Blockbuster.

The only thing preventing me from affording this opportunity to codify an expanded set of rights in the traditionally Libertarian ethos of the founding fathers is this: no one's told me the truth, yet. At one point I felt I didn't need to know, or "ntk", any of it. At this point, I think just enough of the truth can help elevate my fellow citizens to an expanded set of freedoms better suited for a digital world but still framed in an originalist ethic, even if that means I'll have to be a victim in the public's eye, albeit a very special one. I'd rather have been left alone.

From George Orwell via Rage Against the Machine's _Testify_:

Who controls the past now controls the future
Who controls the present now controls the past
Who controls the past now controls the future

Who controls the present now?
