### An Opportunity For All via Justice for Some

If you're reading this, you're aware my privacy has been invaded in a peculiar set of ways.

There are two major legal opportunities to be had via legal actions and lawsuits that I can take - only once I know whom has been invading my privacy. I've always figured I'd learn one way or the other, it would just take the right opportunity. Now there are two such opportunities to set legal precedents by making certain arguments in court such to potentially expand civil rights for all Americans!

The first argument and opportunity is this: if someone's privacy is invaded across state lines via the utility of the internet, with audio and visual recordings being made non consensually in particular, whose jurisdiction is it anyway? While my privacy was invaded in New York and New Jersey, it was presumably linked via the internet the whole time to actors, speaking broadly, in California and other states. California state law is particularly more aggressive towards protecting the right to privacy, in many forms and many ways, than New York and to an extent even New Jersey.

The second argument and opportunity is perhaps greater: can any medical reason whatsoever justify an invasion of privacy in any form? Or, in other words, what is the legal relationship between privacy and medicine? This is to assume that my privacy was invaded for the sake of a medicinal reason. Privacy's lack of legal relations to medicine was the grounds for a previous hot button societal issue, the right to abortion, to be decided as it was. That said, the medicinal reason in question with my own privacy's invasion is not really a hot button issue - not too many people get millions of dollars spent on them to try and misdiagnose them because of other people misunderstanding the business, content, and higher duty to society of cinema - but I digress. Not all of us were so privileged to have worked at a Blockbuster.

The only thing preventing me from affording this opportunity to codify an expanded set of rights in the traditionally Libertarian ethos of the founding fathers is this: no one's told me the truth, yet. At one point I felt I didn't need to know, or "ntk", any of it. At this point, I think just enough of the truth can help elevate my fellow citizens to an expanded set of freedoms better suited for a digital world but still framed in an originalist ethic, even if that means I'll have to be a victim in the public's eye, albeit a very special one. I'd rather have been left alone.

From George Orwell via Rage Against the Machine's _Testify_:

```
Who controls the past now controls the future
Who controls the present now controls the past
Who controls the past now controls the future

Who controls the present now?

Now testify
Testify
It's right outside your door

Now testify
Testify
It's right outside your door
```

### A pre-emptive rebuttal to an inevitable riposte

I'll make this argument in more detail later as this situation persists.

That said, an inevitable counter argument to the above is this:

> It's just not a guarantee.

Followed of course by a littany of commentary, references, and multi-syllabic words (maybe in latin) that all come in a self assured, paternal cadence.

In rebuttal, I'll just say this:

> The fact that it isn't a guarantee is exactly the point.

Way too many people are aware of and watching this situation. Many of them are young and likely to take over the reins of the political machines in the near future. The reason you take the risk now is precisely because so many are watching.

You take the risk to make change, even when it is not a guarantee, such to inspire hope.

Yes, damn right, you can. We can. The otherside spent decades taking all kinds of pot shots at all levels and eventually, it got them success.

And this time, if you don't, everyone watching - not the public, not the American people, just everyone you actually care about - will realize you care more about the hollow nature of unearned celebrity, celebrity without cultural influence, you care more about this than making actual change.

Yes, damn right, we can. And we should. For if we don't, too many will shy away from the basic motivation that allows for the risk which gives us change: hope.

### A break from bombast

Look folks: I'm going to be a bit more diplomatic, particularly with my playlist and social media guitar covers. It's been brought to my attention that I may be perceived as "trolling without cause."

That said, I've been thinking lately - apparently Reed Hastings approached Blockbuster video several times attempting to sell them on a service that eventually became the one he founded, Netflix. What distracted Blockbuster Video from partnering, which in retrospect, would have saved the still forever iconic brand?

I'm going to assume it was an over focus on terrestrial competition of "other" video rental chains.

Anywho, I'm gonna make different choices with the covers, and slow down a bit - I could use the practice.

All that said, "other" folks may attempt to distract those involved by attempting to mis portray me using various forms of edited video footage.

So the question should remain this, at any conversation about yours truly:

> "So wait, it's more important to let you stalk, harass, defame, ruin the employability, and forever mentally scar some random middle aged citizen as opposed to fight for expanded civil rights federally at best, or protect existing civil rights at various state levels at least?"

That is the debate.

### Back to bombast

Truly, the opportunity at hand, given there are no guarantees (pending the extent of witness testimony) to a legal approach, is this:

Inspiring multiple generations of political and legal actors to be _fighters_ for expanded civil rights - to seek opportunity for the greater good, even when it ruffles some feathers at the dinner parties. I think we need fighters for the future we're facing which is already backsliding into some kind of dystopia.

It may cause trouble, but I think it's high time we made, to borrow the words of the immeasurably infinite John Lewis, some "good trouble".

Wow, what a difference that would make!

### A slight recap of the opportunities

So, I'm pretty sure a Reality TV show was being filmed in New York involving me, and footage of it was shared with copious people despite the show defaming me and being filmed without my consent.

New York privacy laws wouldn't have much to say here, but California laws would say that the whole thing, especially the sharing of the footage, would be seen as... bad.

If it can be proven that the content was shared with or within the state of California, or at least routed through computers located in that area, I'd say we have an interesting case to expand privacy laws in an extremely broad way given the crossing of state lines.

In the scope of protecting public shareholder interests, I'd prefer this to be a case where it's one last name against a pseudonym; I think we all know that. I'm not sure if it's possible, and I will not twist anyone's gilded arms into testifying, though that would happen in the best of worlds. ~~Perhaps in this not so best of worlds, muse taxes can instead be considered.~~

...

However, in the separate but related situation where my privacy was invaded based on a medical justification which could not be proven by medical professionals in an standard medically ethical way, there raises the question as to whether a precedent can be established preventing the invasion of privacy based on or concerning medical issues.

It's probably more impactful to certain recently lost federal protections. Even if it cannot reach a federal hearing, it would at least provide a precedent for future cases to expand and relate to.

That said, I don't need this lawsuit to be one last name against pseudonym.

To the "doctors" involved and yes perhaps most responsible for this fiasco, here's my suggestion:

There's a high likelihood that your medical malpractice insurance is connected to your taxable identity, which for many psychiatrist types, is probably just your last name(s). This is unfortunate as a lawsuit here may just end up in the hands of the Supreme Court, and thus a matter for history if not at the very least headlines.

If you hurry up and change your EIN associations to something generic, then the lawsuit that occurs will be my pseudonym vs. your newly established taxable identity, protecting your family's last names and futures from being maligned as working against expanding civil rights in the scope of medical ethics, something I'm sure you agree to broadly, were your careers not to be at risk.

Think it over! Even if the IRS doesn't accept your new tax identity in time for me to sue you, I'll still do you a solid and sue you based on the new identity and not your last names, should that be the case. I'm sure it'll all work out in the end.

(in a voice hearkening back to the vaudevillian "aristocrats" joke): Diplomacy!

### A brief benefit of the doubt

Hey gang! So, something occured to me about my sister's legal team. While it's unclear to me (as is everything in this situation) as to what they _precisely_ said, I've had the inclination that it involved a misrepresentation of the truth to which has triggered a legal disciplinary investigation into said legal team.

Here's the point: I've begun to question, what if my sister's legal team did not feel confident in the argument in question itself? In fact, what if they knew it could backfire insofar as damaging my sister's case for expanded custody given the situation?

What if they formed a legal strategy around risking a misrepresentation of the truth because it was _more important_ to (attempt to) screw me over by "creating hollywood gossip" about me than to serve my sister's best interests as a client, and felt bulletproof to the idea of a legal disciplinary investigation, particularly in a pre-Girardi disbarment California?

Now, I doubt she would hear me out on this, but if others could convince her, would it make my sister interested in testifying towards expanding civil rights? Unfortunately I do not know her very well.

It might be valuable testimony towards one or both of the above, and in one case, might be easier than going with gilded arms, though, it may help to work those gilded arms into nudging my sister as opposed to providing witness testimony themselves in court! ~~Mandatory "redacted" joke about muse taxes~~.

Just some thoughts.
